## Identifiers 

 - `subject` ID of the test subject in the experiment represented by an integer value 1-30
 - `activity`Type of activity being preformed while the measurements were taken 


## Activity lables

-   `WALKING` subject was walking during the test
-   `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` subject was walking up a staircase during the test
-   `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` subject was walking down a staircase during the test
-   `SITTING` subject was sitting during the test
-   `STANDING` subject was standing during the test
-   `LAYING` subject was laying down during the test

## Variables

These are the measurements that were taken from the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the smartphone attached to the subject. Measurements from the accelerometer ('Acc' in the variable names) have units of metres per second squared, mesurements for the gyroscope ('Gyro' in the variable name) have units of radians/second.
